# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: OOP or Object-Oriented-Programming it's a way to code that uses mainly objects and classes,
Functional Programming it uses functions as its main component.

Researched answer: OOP is a programming paradigm in which objects are the main unit, while Functional Programming is a declarative
programming paradigm that writes in pure functions. In Functional Programming you cannot create mutable objects while on OOP you can have
both mutable and immutable objects also OOP is more an imperative programming approach while Functional Programming is a more declarative programming model.

2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A Float is a data type that gives numbers with only 1 decimal, a Integer is a data type that gives whole numbers.

Researched answer: A Float is a datatype used for more accurate values and Integer for data that you need a more rounded number. Also there's another data type called Decimals which is even more accurate than Float and usually is commonly used for complex financial applications.

3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: It means you do not need to input a 'return' statement in Ruby to get the expected returning output. 

Researched answer: In Ruby the value of the last statement in a method is automatically returned. 
It can be very convenient and help make code more readable.

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: Block in Ruby is code statement that is grouped together.

Researched answer: In Ruby, a block is a piece of code that can be passed to a method like an argument, they can take multiple parameters, and can be written using either curly braces or the 'do...end' syntax.

5. How do you extract a value in a Ruby hash?

Your answer: Using the bracket notation, example: 'hash = { name: "henri" , age: 30 }'
'puts hash[:name]'  'op: "henri"'
Researched answer: You can extract a value from a Ruby has by using either the bracket notation or the fetch method ( puts has.fetch(:key, "value")).

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. RSpec: It is a tool for writing automated tests that checks if your Ruby code is working correctly. You can write codes in plain english that describes what is the objective of your code and it will check if your code does what it was created for. This tool helps you catch bugs before your code goes live and make sure your code works the way it was supposed to.

2. Test-driven development: It is a software development process where developers write automated tests before they write the actual code. The code is written incrementaly, which means that with each iteration you would have a test and the necessary code to make that test pass. With TDD we ensure that the code meets the requirements and avoids the need for manual testing, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

3. PostgreSQL: It is a open-source relational database management system that is used to manage and store data. It uses the Structured Query Language SQL to communicate with the database and supports a wide range of features, transactions, views and stored procedures. It is reliable, scalable, and extensible. Can be used in multiple operating system and with various programming languages.

4. CRUD: is the acronym for Ruby Hashes:
C - Create -> make a new hash
 R - Read -> to return your data
  U - Update -> can add more content
   D - Delete/Destroy -> removes content

5. HTTP: HypertextTransferProtocol is a set of rules that defines how information is exchanged over the internet.It is the foundational of data comunication for the WorldWideWeb. HTTP establishes a connection between a client(usually a web browser) and a server, and specifying how the data should behave, formatted and transferred. It allows the user interaction with web applications and services.
